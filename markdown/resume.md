Experience
----------

**Globalization Architect at Veritas (October 2015-Present)**

Designing product architecture for internationalization readiness and localizability.
Evangelizing to increase I18N awareness across the development and design teams.
Managing the end-to-end globalization process with integrations between the CMS systems, Machine Translation engine, and Translation Management System.

* Designed and led the implementation of the continuous localization system that allowed to reduce localization update time by 70%

* Led a team of automation engineers responsible for building an internal screenshot review portal and the internationalization testing library

* Open sourced automation tools: [Globalization Automation Library](https://github.com/VeritasOS/glob-auto-library) and [Assisted Review Portal](https://github.com/VeritasOS/assisted-review-portal)

* Maintained corpus and trained the machine translations engines (both statistical and neural), obtaining BLEU scores of 50+ for Asian, and 55+ for European languages

* Built internal translation portal, streamlining ad-hoc localization requests

* Led the migration of Translation Management System to XTM Cloud

**Senior Principal Internationalization Engineer at Symantec (July 2015-October 2015)**

Responsible for migration of the globalization systems to a new infrastructure when Symantec was spinning off Veritas as a separate entity.

* Documented the globalization process after gathering information from cross functional teams

* Planned and executed move of 10+ globalization tools and systems

* Introduced improvements and cost savings in the machine translation processes

**Principal Internationalization Engineer at Symantec (July 2013 - June 2015)**

Providing internationalization architecture for complex applications, enabling localizability, evaluating UX for global users.

* Developed static code analysis system allowing to find internationalization issues on the early stages of the development process

* Designed integration allowing to run the static code analysis searching for internationalization issues in the CI and Development environments

**Senior Software Engineer at Symantec (July 2010 – June 2013)**

Configuration management in the internationalization group, mainly focusing on localizability aspects of the applications.

* Designed improvements to the pseudo-translation method - using statistics from the existing translations allowed to better mimic actual text length vastly reducing number of false positives

**Software Engineer at Symantec (July 2006 - June 2010)**

Configuration management in software localization group.

* Maintained and improved localization build system and localization tools

**Localization Engineer at Symantec (January 2003 - June 2006)**

Leading small team of localization engineers.

* Released localized versions of enterprise products to European and Asian languages with time to marked reduced from 6 months to 2 weeks

**Localization Quality Assurance Engineer at Symantec (September 2003 - December 2003)**

Testing localized version of the Norton products.

Technical Experience
--------------------

**C#, .NET Core, WebAPI, Entity Framework, NUnit:** Used .NET stack to build scalable REST API back-end applications: continuous localization system, internal translation API, automation reporting API, static code scanning reporting and configuration API.

**Angular, TypeScript, npm, webpack, Protractor:** Built front-ends for globalization tools using the Angular stack. Built JavaScript internationalization library and distributed it as an npm package. Developed Protractor test cases for testing web application UI, and taking screenshots for linguistic review.

**Java:** Analyzed, suggested and implemented I18N fixes to multiple applications written in Java, including string externalization to resource bundles, date/time/number formatting and concatenation issues.

**SQL:** Designed and implemented high performing translation database for the software strings. Helped to resolve issues with SQL internationalization like non-Unicode column types, and incorrect collation.

**Regular Expressions:** In-depth hands-on knowledge - used RegEx to configure resource file parsing and the static code scanning.

**Localization standards:** Comprehensive knowledge of XLIFF and TMX. Developed TMX cleanup/migration tool. Developed XLIFF comparer/analyzer providing BLEU, TER and PE-distance scores.

**[Certified Jenkins Engineer](https://certificates.cloudbees.com/10297945):** Automated globalization update process, test environment setup, and globalization analysis tasks with Jenkins pipelines.

Publications
------------

**[Best Practices in Translation Memory Management](https://github.com/GILT-Forum/TM-Mgmt-Best-Practices/blob/master/best-practices.md)** - co-author of a paper published under GILT Leaders Forum's TM Management Task Force, documenting the results of a research and survey about handling translation memories.

**[Predicting the Length of Translated Text Using Statistics](http://ip.com/IPCOM/000230931)** — author of a defensive publication, describing a method of predicting the length (width) of text after translation by using existing translations of the same or similar English texts.

[**Algorithms for digital watermarking of the audio signal**](https://repo.pw.edu.pl/info.seam?id=WEITI-b9b44f4b-277f-4e1f-bcff-8991968561fd) (Polish) — co-author of a paper describing the application of an auto-cepstrum analysis to detect a binary data embedded in the audio signal as an echo undetectable to a human ear.
